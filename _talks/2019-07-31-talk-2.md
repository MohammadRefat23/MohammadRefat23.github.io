Looking at a star’s position will not give you the full picture of its life. To fully grasp the history of a star, we can look at its chemistry and kinematics. From high-resolution spectra of red giants, we can get both of these sets of information and assess the formation site of stars in the Milky Way. To do this we measure the strengths of absorption lines from red giant spectra. From there, we iteratively fit stellar atmospheric parameters to existing models. Using the red giant standard star Arcturus, we verified that our results are consistent with the current literature. Our next steps will be to apply this methodology to a larger set of red giants in the Milky Way to distinguish between formation scenarios for these stars.
