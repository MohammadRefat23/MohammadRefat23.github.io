Stellar streams are large, curvilinear groups of stars that stretch across the sky and orbit the Milky Way, much akin to a flock of birds. We present the discovery of at least one new member of the recently discovered Jhelum Stellar Stream, located approximately 13 kpc away. We use astrometric, photometric, and kinematic data from Gaia and APOGEE-2 to isolate stars as stream members. Based on the chemical signature of Jhelum members, we find that the progenitor of the Jhelum Stream is a dwarf galaxy, accreted billions of years ago via tidal disruption from the Milky Wayâ€™s gravity.
