Brown dwarfs and directly-imaged exoplanets have atmospheres with complex clouds. Mapping the surfaces of these objects allows us to better characterize brown dwarfs and exoplanets. Variability monitoring is a powerful tool that can probe these clouds, and has been carried out for a large number of brown dwarfs and a small but growing number of directly-imaged exoplanets. Recently, Tan et al. (2021) used three-dimensional atmospheric models to simulate the atmospheres of exoplanets and brown dwarfs. These models produce the most detailed surface maps to date, and produce light curve variability similar to what has been observed in brown dwarfs. With this simulated dataset, we are able to test current mapping techniques for potential future exoplanet research.
