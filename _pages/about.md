I am a second year student at the [City University of New York’s Graduate Center’s](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/physics) [Master's in Astrophysics](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/astrophysics) program in New York City. My current research is in brown dwarf atmospheres and I am primarily interested in galactic archaeology and exoplanets. I am currently doing research with [Dr. Lucy Lu](https://astronomy.osu.edu/people/lu.3234) for my Master's Thesis.

You can see a list of my publications via [ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/p_=0&q=orcid%3A0000-0003-3149-4501&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc).

Research Interests
======
My current research interest is in light curve inversion techniques in order to study starspots.

Previously, I have studied brown dwarf and exoplanet atmospheres, chemical tagging of stellar streams, spectra of stars and statistics in the star-forming intersellar medium.

About me
======
I started my undergraduate studies as a math major at [Baruch College](https://mfeapp.baruch.cuny.edu/math/). In 2019, I transfered into the [CUNY Baccalaureate for Unique and Interdisciplinary Studies](https://cunyba.cuny.edu/) program to major in astrophysics. After graduating, I enrolled in the Graduate Center's masters in Astrophysics program.
