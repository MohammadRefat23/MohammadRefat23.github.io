Here are some of the research projects that I have worked on through out my undergraduate and master's degree

Starspot Inference Using Light Curve Inversion Techniques
=========================================================
Using light curve inversion packages, I am studying how these different methods can help us understand starspots from using light curve data. 

Towards Mapping Brown Dwarf and Giant Exoplanet Atmospheres
=========================================================
Using simulated light curve data, I mapped their surfaces using the Starry package.

Chemodynamically Characterizing the Jhelum Stellar Stream with APOGEE-2
=========================================================
Examined the Jhelum stellar stream in order to characterize potential members using APOGEE-2. Identified one potential member of Jhelum. Resulted in publication Sheffield et al (incl. Refat), ApJ, 2021.

Looking at Star Formation Through Chemistry
=========================================================
Analyzed the spectra of the M-Giant star Arcturus to derive stellar spectra and chemical abundances.
Normalized Echelle spectra and measured equivalent widths of spectral lines.

Two-Point Statistics in the Star Forming ISM
=========================================================
Performed a two-point correlation analysis to characterize metallicity correlation between stars and compared
this to parameters such as velocity and star formation rate.

Staying in Science
=========================================================
Wrote memos and gave information to create social network maps in order to study studentsâ€™ career pathways.
Also studied survey data of students from historically marginalized backgrounds in STEM after they
participated in science research mentoring programs.
