Here are some of the research projects that I have worked on through out my undergraduate and master's degree

Starspot Inference Using Light Curve Inversion Techniques
=========================================================
Using light curve inversion packages, I am studying how these different methods can help us understand starspots from using light curve data. 

Towards Mapping Brown Dwarf and Giant Exoplanet Atmospheres
=========================================================
Using simulated light curve data, I mapped their surfaces using the Starry package.
